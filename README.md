## Project Structure

Here is a rough outline of the folders and files:


- `html/` — contains `.html` files (home, about, etc.)  
- `css/` — external CSS files used by HTML pages  
- `javascript/` — any JS files for interactive behavior  
- `assets/` — images and other static media  

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BoumedineRayan/WebProject.git

Usage

Use the navigation menu to move between pages.

Any interactive elements (buttons, forms, JS) should function as designed (e.g. validate input, show/hide content).

Modify the CSS or JS files to change styling or behavior.

Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (ES6+)

(Optionally, if any libraries are used, list them: e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.)

Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas you could implement later:

Add form submission / backend handling

Improve mobile responsive breakpoints

Add animations or transitions

Use CSS preprocessor (Sass / Less)

Optimize images / lazy load

Add a 404 error page or fallback
